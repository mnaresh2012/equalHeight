#equalHeight Plug-in (BETA)
An useful plug-in for the e-commerce web application. What it does is, it will check a collection of elements height and return with the highest one. The highest value will apply to the each element.

###Dependencies - 
jQuery - 
We can achieve this functionality with native javascript as-well. But I did with jQuery. Because of it's popularity.
###Usage and Example -
For more details, follow the link - [mnaresh2012.github.io](http://mnaresh2012.github.io/index.html)
```
To initialze the plugin -
$('#myContainer ul li').equalHeight();
```
